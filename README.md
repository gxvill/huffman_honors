# Project Overview

- A place to organize my cs20 honors project

The project is going to be a huffman coding compressions algorithm

I hope this readme file works that way I want it to.

## Goals given by PK:

- [x] create a program that takes the input of a file, and creates a map of all the characters
    - this step was easier that I thought it would be, it just uses the txt file, then adds them to the map

## Huffman File Compression/Decompression

### Guiding Question/Thesis/Idea
Files are a necessary part of life in the modern digital age. All information needs to be stored as a file at some point or another. A problem arises when too much information needs to be kept, but there isnâ€™t enough space to keep all the files in their original state. File compression and decompression solves this problem. It allows for data to be stored in a smaller amount of space than the original file would take up. Allowing for a greater density of information. I aim to create a file compression and decompression algorithm using the Huffman encoding technique. 

### Method of Research
I will familiarize myself with the Huffman encoding technique. Understanding the processes of building binary trees using symbol frequencies. I will then study the implementation of binary trees into C++. After that, I will create the encoder and decoder where I make sure that the compressed files contain the necessary information for decompression. The program will be console based and will only be using the C++ standard library. Additionally, I will add statistics benchmarking the before and after sizes of the compressed files. These statistics will also be testing the efficiency of the algorithm when applied to different file types. Allowing for a broad understanding of the quality of the compression algorithm. I will meet with my professor once every 3 weeks in order to check in on my progress and obtain feedback.

### Outcome
The outcome of this project will be a C++ command line tool that:
- [ ] Encodes a file into a compressed binary file using Huffman coding. 
- [ ] Decodes a compressed binary file back into the original file.
- [ ] Reports statistics such as the before and after sizes of the file.
- [ ] Comparison of my compression algorithm statistics to current available compression utilities.
- [ ] Write up describing the process and product of the project. Will be at least 6 pages long.

### Project Timeline

     - still in progress
- [ ] October 10: Begin first draft of program
- [ ] November 14: Clean code and debug for final program, begin write up
- [ ] December 12: Submit final program and write up to professor
